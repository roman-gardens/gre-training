### Join the team!

This site will move into the future with a team of dedicated scholars who will continue to build the site to meet the needs of current scholarship. Please contact [Kathryn Gleason](mailto:klg16@cornell.edu) if you would like to work on the digital humanities aspect of the project or would like to contribute in traditional analog formats. We are also looking for individuals with advanced skills in Hugo and Github to assist with trouble shooting.

### Content Corrections/Errors

### Support the Project

Although this website has been designed to function inexpensively using volunteers, we can do more with the project if we can train and support more students, young scholars, and technical experts. If you are interested in being a project collaborator or supporter, contact [Kathryn Gleason](mailto:klg16@cornell.edu). Donations may be made to a collaborating institution or to the Society for Garden Archaeology.
