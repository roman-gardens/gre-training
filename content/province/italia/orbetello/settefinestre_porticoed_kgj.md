[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Sublocation Description

Settefinestre, near Orbetello in Tuscany, provides an example of the great villas of Central Italy purposely constructed for intensive agriculture and specialized stock raising (Figs. 1, 2). Located in central Etruria, in the territory of Cosa, it was built between 40 and 30 B.C. by a member of the gens Sestia. The complex closely matches Varro’s account of the villa perfecta, where buildings for production and profit (*pars rustica* and *fructuaria*) were seamlessly welded to an urban luxury dwelling (*pars urbana*).

The central nucleus of the villa covered 2780 m2, with just under 3000 m2 of formal gardens, and a further 1000 m2 of kitchen gardens. Thus the horti represented three fifths of the enclosed area of the estate. Outside the complex there were minor buildings, threshing areas and an orchard with a nursery, planted close to the entrance. Elsewhere there were enclosed spaces that were possibly used for climbing plants, as well as vases and beds containing herbs. Outlying fields offered specialized cultivation and woodlands serving the villa (circa villam).  Nothing has been preserved of the various outdoor furnishings except for a few fragments of planting pots.  In the second century C.E.., when the villa passed into imperial hands, the formal gardens with their symmetrical beds were dismantled and transformed into spaces for exercise or agriculture.
