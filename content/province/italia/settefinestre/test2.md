## Location Description

<!-- LEAVE THIS BLANK FOR NOW -->
Settefinestre, near Orbetello in Tuscany, provides an example of the great villas of Central Italy purposely constructed for intensive agriculture and specialized stock raising (Figs. 1, 2). Located in central Etruria, in the territory of Cosa, it was built between 40 and 30 B.C. by a member of the *gens* Sestia. The complex closely matches Varro’s account of the *villa perfecta*, where buildings for production and profit (*pars rustica* and *fructuaria*) were seamlessly welded to an urban luxury dwelling (*pars urbana*).   
<!-- # Sublocation -->


<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.
