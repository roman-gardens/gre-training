# Gardens of the Roman Empire -- training repo

orbetello branch

This repo contains a small subset of the full GRE repo, and is designed for training.  People in training to become GRE editors can use this repo to practice making edits and become familiar with using Atom, Git, and GitHub without fear of wreaking the public website!

## Hugo

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Mainroad](https://themes.gohugo.io/mainroad/) theme.

## Basic Development

Create new garden pages using the command: `hugo new garden/GARDEN_NAME.md`

`GARDEN_NAME` should be the full name of the garden as it will be written in the article, with any spaces replaced with underscores, plus the extension `.md`.
E.g.:

Garden Title: *Big Two-Hearted River*
File name: `big_two-hearted_river.md`
